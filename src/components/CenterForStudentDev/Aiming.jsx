                  students through every phase of their academic and personal
                  journey. At the heart of ACSD lies a belief in the power of
                  mentorship and personalised attention, enabling students to

                Through one-on-one mentoring and group activities, ACSD supports
                the personal and social development of students in Bangalore,
                enabling them to better understand themselves and their
                aspirations. By helping them navigate both opportunities and
                challenges, ACSD ensures that each student experiences their
                time at AIMS as a transformative journey, not just an academic
                one.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-base lg:text-base monser-400">
                Whether a student needs career guidance, skill-building support,
                or simply someone to talk to, ACSD provides a consistent
                touchpoint for care, structure, and encouragement. The emphasis
                is always on student well-being initiatives in Bangalore
                colleges that are practical, human, and future-focused.
