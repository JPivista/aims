                    At AIMS, students are never alone in their research journey. The AIMS Centre for Research ensures that learners at the undergraduate and postgraduate level have access to the mentorship, tools, and institutional support needed to pursue research with clarity.

                    From training in tools and guidance to prepare research projects in colleges, students benefit from workshops and access to faculty and industry experts. This student-first approach is what makes AIMS one of the leading colleges with research guidance to endorse the research proposals in Bangalore.
