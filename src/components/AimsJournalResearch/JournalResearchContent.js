                            The University Grants Commission (UGC), India has (in the XI Plan) made a policy decision to direct all Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) to establish Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a mechanism to build and ensure a quality culture at the institutional level.

                            AIMS Internal Quality Assurance Cell (AIQAC) was established in April 2007 as a facilitative and participative organ of AIMS Institutes with the primary objective to build and ensure a quality culture and standardise its processes and procedures. The cell has over the years taken initiatives to bring in uniformity, transparency and coordination in academic and non-academic processes for the efficient delivery of the responsibilities to achieve targeted results.
