                Founded in 2009, the AIMS Centre for Community Service (ACCS)
                serves as a bridge between the classroom and the community.
                Designed to foster civic responsibility and empathy, the centre
                helps students turn learning into meaningful action through
                structured college community service programs in Bangalore.

                From blood donation drives and health camps to sanitation
                campaigns and collaborations with NGOs in Bangalore, ACCS offers
                students opportunities to contribute to the world around them,
                not out of obligation, but out of purpose. These experiences
                build self-awareness, deepen social responsibility, and instil
                values that last well beyond the classroom.

                At ACCS, we believe education must extend beyond campus walls.
                That's why we work closely with both urban and rural communities
                to design initiatives that reflect real needs and long-term
                impact.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm md:text-base monser-400">
                Each initiative is hands-on and inclusive, helping students
                across departments take part in student-led social initiatives
                in Bangalore. Whether it's volunteering at rehabilitation
                centres or running HIV/AIDS awareness programs by colleges in
                Bangalore, ACCS encourages every student to AIM for a better
                tomorrow.
