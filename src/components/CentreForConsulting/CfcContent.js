                                Established to bridge the gap between theory and practice, the AIMS Centre for Consulting (ACC) is designed to give students and faculty hands-on exposure to the world of industry-led problem-solving.

                                The centre actively partners with corporates and NGOs to provide management consulting services in Bangalore colleges, allowing students and mentors alike to engage with real-world challenges and make tangible contributions.

                                Our belief is simple: learning becomes transformational when it is applied. That’s why ACC doesn’t just teach, it enables.
